DBModelR
========

The DBModelR is an ORM package (Object-Relationnal Mapping). This ORM aims to abstract the database layer in R programs, and provide simple objects to create, load, update and remove data fom the database transparently, using only R Objects.

It's built atop of RSQLite and R-DBI, but may include other DBMS like PostGreSQL, or MySQL.

You can install the latest released version from CRAN with:

install.packages("DBModelR")

Or install the latest development version from GitHub with:

devtools::install\_github("LainPavot/DBModelR")

Basic usage
===========

``` r
library("RSQLite")
library("DBModelR")
```

    ## Loading required package: purrr

``` r
models <- list(
    person=ModelDefinition(
        table="person",
        fields=list(
            name="TEXT",
            family_name="TEXT"
        ), many=list("adress")
        ## One person possibly has multiple adress. Or none...
        ## "many" fields defines the creation of a linkage table
        ## (many_to_many or one_to_many).
        ## "one" fields defines a fk field enforced by a foreign key
        ## restriction (one_to_one)
        ## "many" fields mustn't be duplicated. So, "adress" must not
        ## reference the "person" table.
    ),
    adress=ModelDefinition(
        table="adress",
        fields=list(
            number="INTEGER",
            street="TEXT"
        )
    )
)

DB_PATH <- "./people.sqlite"
if (file.exists(DB_PATH)) {
    file.remove(DB_PATH)
}
orm <- ORM(connection_params=list(DB_PATH), model_definitions=models)

## like this, we'll see the requests generated by the orm
print(orm$create_database())
```

    ## [[1]]
    ## [1] "CREATE TABLE  person (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, family_name TEXT)"
    ## 
    ## [[2]]
    ## [1] "CREATE TABLE  adress (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, number INTEGER, street TEXT)"
    ## 
    ## [[3]]
    ## [1] "CREATE TABLE  adress_person (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, adress_id INTEGER, person_id INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES person (id), FOREIGN KEY (adress_id) REFERENCES adress (id))"

``` r
## the tables has been generated, fks and their restrictions has been
## defined and linked table has been created if necessary

## we've created a person who's name is Alice Smith.
## Alice has been saved into the database.
alice <- orm$person(name="Alice", family_name="smith")$save()

## Alice has been successfully added to and loaded from the database.
print(orm$person()$load_by(name="Alice"))
```

    ## [1] "list"
    ## Reference class object of class "ResultSet"
    ## Field "result_set__":
    ## [[1]]
    ## <person [id: 1]>: 
    ##   [name: "Alice"]
    ##   [family_name: "smith"]
    ##   
    ## Field "length__":
    ## [1] 1

``` r
## The id is 1, because it's the first person to be inserted into the
## "person" table.
## The orm has generated an "INSERT" query.
print(alice$get_id())
```

    ## [1] 1

``` r
## He's a boy, so he's changed his name to "Bob". Suits him better.
## Fields must always be setted with "model$set_field_name(value)".
## otherwise the orm will not see the modifications, and will not save
## them in the database.
bob <- alice$set_name("bob")$save()

## still 1. Because the orm did not add new database entry.
## The orm has generated an "UPDATE" query.
print(bob$get_id())
```

    ## [1] 1

``` r
## prints an empty list()
## no adress has been assigned to him for the moment.
print(bob$get_adress())
```

    ## [1] "NULL"
    ## Reference class object of class "ResultSet"
    ## Field "result_set__":
    ## list()
    ## Field "length__":
    ## [1] 0

``` r
## let's give him a home
bob$add_adress(
    ## the orm sanitizes the user's inputs and prevent sql injections.
    orm$adress(number=42, street="Second street ; -- drop table person")
)
```

    ## <person [id: 1]>: 
    ##   [name: "bob"]
    ##   [family_name: "smith"]
    ## 

``` r
## The orm detects that the adress object assigned to bob is not saved
## yet in the database.
## So, the orm will register the adress, and then create a link between
## bob and the adress through a linkage table.
bob$save()
```

    ## <person [id: 1]>: 
    ##   [name: "bob"]
    ##   [family_name: "smith"]
    ## 

``` r
## now Bob is happy because he has an adress
## prints: list(<adress id: 1> ...) etc.
print(adress <- bob$get_adress())

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r

Context
=======

This package has been initialized in the ANR RHU project ChoPIn (Cholesterol Personnelized Innovations), at the "plateforme d'exploration du metabolisme" (Metabolism exploration plateform - PFEM), at INRAE of Clermont-Theix in France.

The ORM was a part of the "XSeeker" tool that I was coding, and I decided to make a more compleet tool. So on my free time, I created this package, largly inspired from the original code.
