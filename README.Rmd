DBModelR
======
The DBModelR is an ORM package (Object-Relationnal Mapping).
This ORM aims to abstract the database layer in R programs, and provide
simple objects to create, load, update and remove data fom the database
transparently, using only R Objects.

It's built atop of RSQLite and R-DBI, but may include other DBMS like
PostGreSQL, or MySQL.

You can install the latest released version from github with:

remotes::install_github("LainPavot/DBModelR")

Or install the latest development version from GitHub with:

Basic usage
======

```{r}



```


Context
======

This package has been initialized in the ANR RHU project ChoPIn
(Cholesterol Personnelized Innovations), at the "plateforme
d'exploration du metabolisme" (Metabolism exploration
plateform - PFEM), at INRAE of Clermont-Theix in France.

The ORM was a part of the "XSeeker" tool that I was coding at PFEM, and
I decided to make a more complete tool. So on my free time, I have
created this package.
This package does not have anything in common with the original code
from XSeeker code anymore.
